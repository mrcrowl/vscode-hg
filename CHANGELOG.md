  - You can now choose between named-branches or bookmarks.
  - Set `"hg.useBookmarks": true` for bookmarks.
  - New supporting commands:
    - Set Bookmark
    - Remove Bookmark
  - Also affects: update / push / pull / autoInOut
  - See [#10](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/10) for complete details.

Shoutout to [ajansveld](https://github.com/ajansveld) for the ideas and help with testing these new features.

### Changes to settings

- The new `hg.autoUpdate` setting is on by default.
- New setting `hg.pushPullScope` replaces `hg.pushPullBranch` (which is now deprecated) but remains for backwards compatibility. Using `hg.pushPullScope` affects both named-branches and bookmarks modes.

## [1.0.7]

### What's New

- Faster commits. The outgoing/incoming check is now separate from the commit.
- New setting `hg.pushPullBranch` controls which branch(es) will be pushed/pulled [#8](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/8)
  - `all`: all branches (this is the default)
  - `current`: only the current branch
  - `default`: only the default branch
- `hg.autoInOut` setting and status-bar display respects `hg.pushPullBranch`
- Spinning icon while pushing/pulling.

## [1.0.5-6]

### What's New

- Improvements to commandMode `server` reliability.
- Marketplace category change --> SCM Providers [PR #5]

## [1.0.4]

### What's New

- If you have staged files when you rollback a commit, then all files from the rolled-back commit become staged too.
- Attempt to fix issue with non-ascii commit messages encoding. [Issue #4](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/4)

### Change to defaults

- Default HGENCODING is now utf-8, unless an existing environment variable exists.

## [1.0.3]

### What's New

- The context menu commands "Open Changes" and "Open File" now work with multiple selections in source control.
- These commands are also available in each group-level context menu (e.g. Changes or Staged Changes).

### Change to defaults

- `cli` is now the default commandMode. Although `server` is faster, it occasionally causes hangs.
- I will attempt to track down the cause of the hangs before reverting this change.
- In the meantime, if you prefer `server`, you'll need to add a user-setting.

### Bug Fixes

- When using Undo/Rollback to undo a commit, the last commit message is properly restored.

## [1.0.2]

### What's New

- A commit including missing files now prompts for these to be deleted before committing.
- With `hg.autoInOut` enabled, the status is shown as a tick when there are no incoming/outgoing changesets.
- With `hg.autoInOut` enabled, the status bar tooltip shows when the next check time will be.
- Problems with push/pull operations now show an error indicator on the status bar.

### Bug Fixes

- Rollback/Undo now updates the count of outgoing commits immediately.
- When you attempt to pull with no default path configured, the option to 'Open hgrc' now works from the error prompt.
- With `hg.autoInOut` disabled, the incoming count is no longer shown after you commit.
