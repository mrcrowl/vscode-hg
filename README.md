# Overview

### Integrated Mercurial source control

# Prerequisites

> **Note**: This extension leverages your 
> machine's Mercurial (hg) installation,  
> so you need to [install Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) first.

# Features

 * Add files and commit from the source control side-bar (i.e. where git normally appears).

 * All the basics: commit, add, forget, update, push and pull. 

 * See changes inline within text editor. 

 * Interactive log for basic file history and diff.

 * Branch, merge heads, merge with branch, resolve + unresolve files.

 * Quickly switch branches, push and pull via status bar.

 * Supports named-branches or bookmark workflows.

 * Automatic incoming/outgoing counters. 

 * Undo/rollback.
 

# Feedback & Contributing

 * Please report any bugs, suggestions or documentation requests via the [Github issues](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues) (_yes_, I see the irony).
 * Feel free to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/pulls).


## Initialize a new repo

![Init a repo](images/init.gif) 

  * Just click the Mercurial icon from the source control title area:

## Update to a branch/tag/bookmark

![Change branches](images/change-branch.gif)

  * The current branch name is shown in the bottom-left corner.
  * Click it to see a list of branches and tags that you can update to.
  * When `hg.useBookmarks` is enabled, this changes to bookmarks.

# Settings

`hg.enabled { boolean }`
  * Enables Hg as a source control manager in VS Code.

`hg.useBookmarks { boolean }`
  * Choose between [bookmarks](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Bookmarks) vs. [named-branches](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/NamedBranches):  
  `"false"` — named-branches mode (default)  
  `"true"` — bookmarks mode  

`hg.pushPullScope { all | current | default }`
  * Specifies what to include in Push/Pull operations.
  * Depends on the choice of `hg.useBookmarks`.
  * For named-branches mode: &nbsp; (i.e. `hg.useBookmarks` = false)  
  `"all"` &mdash; all branches / unrestricted (this is the default)  
  `"current"` &mdash; only includes changesets for the current branch  
  `"default"` &mdash; only includes changesets for the _default_ branch
  * For bookmarks mode: &nbsp; (i.e. `hg.useBookmarks` = true)  
  `"all"` &mdash; all bookmarks / unrestricted (this is the default)  
  `"current"` &mdash; only includes changesets for the active bookmark  
  `"default"` &mdash; only includes changesets for bookmarks on the _default_ branch

`hg.pushPullBranch` _**DEPRECATED**_ `{ all | current | default }`
  * Use `hg.pushPullScope` instead.
  * Specifies which branch(es) should be included in Push/Pull operations. 
  * Included only for backwards compatibility.
  
`hg.autoUpdate { boolean }`
  * Enables automatic update of working directory to branch/bookmark head after pulling (equivalent to `hg pull --update`)  
  `"true"` &mdash; enabled  
  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual update/merge required

`hg.autoInOut { boolean }`
  * Enables automatic counting of incoming/outgoing changes.
  * When enabled, these show in the status bar.
  * Updated every 3 minutes, or whenever a commit/push/pull is done.
  * Note: when `hg.pushPullBranch` is set to `"current"` or `"default"` then only the respective branch will be included in the counts.
  
`hg.autoRefresh { boolean }`
  * Enables automatic refreshing of Source Control tab and badge counter when files within the project change:  
  `"true"` &mdash; enabled  
  `"false"` &mdash; disabled, manual refresh still available.
    
`hg.countBadge { tracked | all | off }`
  * Controls the badge counter for Source Control in the activity bar:  
  `"tracked"` &mdash; only count changes to tracked files (default).  
  `"all"` &mdash; include untracked files in count.  
  `"off"` &mdash; no badge counter.
  
`hg.allowPushNewBranches { boolean }`
  * Overrides the warning that normally occurs when a new branch is pushed:  
  `"true"` &mdash; new branches are pushed without warning (default).  
  `"false"` &mdash; shows a prompt when new branches are being pushed (e.g `hg push --new-branch`)

`hg.path { string | null }`
  * Specifies an explicit `hg` file path to use.
  * This should only be used if `hg` cannot be found automatically.
  * The default behaviour is to search for `hg` in commonly-known install locations and on the PATH.
  
`hg.commandMode`
  * Controls the method used to communicate with `hg`.
  * There is a slight start-up performance cost with repeatedly running `hg` commands.
  * Running a [command server](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer) process in the background allows frequently-used commands to run ~10× faster (e.g. `cat`, `status`, `summary`, `branch` etc.)  
  * The server feature is still expiremental, and is therefore not the default.
  `"cli"` &mdash; spawn a new `hg` process per command (default).
  `"server"` &mdash; run a command server process &nbsp;_i.e. `hg serve --cmdserve`_  

`hg.annotationEnabled`
  * Enables annotation decorations at end of lines
  * Window needs to be reloaded for changes to take effect

`hg.annotationColor`
  * Specifies the color of line annotations
  * Should be a hex color code
