    -   Set `"hg.useBookmarks": true` for bookmarks.
    -   New supporting commands:
        -   Set Bookmark
        -   Remove Bookmark
    -   Also affects: update / push / pull / autoInOut
    -   See [#10](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/10) for complete details.

-   Auto update after pull: `hg.autoUpdate` [#15](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/15)
    -   On by default

Shoutout to [ajansveld](https://github.com/ajansveld) for the ideas and help with testing these new features.

## Changes to settings

-   The new `hg.autoUpdate` setting is on by default.
-   New setting `hg.pushPullScope` replaces `hg.pushPullBranch` (which is now deprecated) but remains for backwards compatibility. Using `hg.pushPullScope` affects both named-branches and bookmarks modes.

# **v1.0.7**

## What's New

-   Faster commits. The outgoing/incoming check is now separate from the commit.
-   New setting `hg.pushPullBranch` controls which branch(es) will be pushed/pulled [#8](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/8)
    -   `all`: all branches (this is the default)
    -   `current`: only the current branch
    -   `default`: only the default branch
-   `hg.autoInOut` setting and status-bar display respects `hg.pushPullBranch`
-   Spinning icon while pushing/pulling.

# **v1.0.5-6**

## What's New

-   Improvements to commandMode `server` reliability.
-   Marketplace category change --> SCM Providers [PR #5]

# **v1.0.4**

## What's New

-   If you have staged files when you rollback a commit, then all files from the rolled-back commit become staged too.
-   Attempt to fix issue with non-ascii commit messages encoding. [Issue #4](https://github.com/mrcrowl/vscode-hg/issues/4)

## Change to defaults

-   Default HGENCODING is now utf-8, unless an existing environment variable exists.

# **v1.0.3**

## What's New

-   The context menu commands "Open Changes" and "Open File" now work with multiple selections in source control.
-   These commands are also available in each group-level context menu (e.g. Changes or Staged Changes).

## Change to defaults

-   `cli` is now the default commandMode. Although `server` is faster, it occasionally causes hangs.
-   I will attempt to track down the cause of the hangs before reverting this change.
-   In the meantime, if you prefer `server`, you'll need to add a user-setting.

## Bug Fixes

-   When using Undo/Rollback to undo a commit, the last commit message is properly restored.

# **v1.0.2**

## What's New

-   A commit including missing files now prompts for these to be deleted before committing.
-   With `hg.autoInOut` enabled, the status is shown as a tick when there are no incoming/outgoing changesets.
-   With `hg.autoInOut` enabled, the status bar tooltip shows when the next check time will be.
-   Problems with push/pull operations now show an error indicator on the status bar.

## Bug Fixes

-   Rollback/Undo now updates the count of outgoing commits immediately.
-   When you attempt to pull with no default path configured, the option to 'Open hgrc' now works from the error prompt.
-   With `hg.autoInOut` disabled, the incoming count is no longer shown after you commit.
